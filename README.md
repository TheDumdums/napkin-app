<h2 align="center">What is Pannik?</h2>

Pannik is an application that allows the user to express their ideas visually. Our team wishes to provides its users a way to quickly relay what they had written on a piece of napkin onto the internet. This will help save ideas that could've easily been forgotten or worse, thrown away. An easy to use application that easily starts with the canvas to start drawing with all the necessary tools provided.

<h3 align="center">What is the Problem?</h3>

Have an idea, but don't have the necessary items needed? Having no choice but to quickly find an item to jott it down before you forget? Such as a napkin?

But what happens after that? That piece of napkin is easily disposable and could easily be lost and forgotten. Not only that, but there is no way to share your idea with anyone else without literally giving it them. And even then only one person could see it at a time.

Pannik puts an emphasis on simplicity and quickness to save your ideas similar to that of jotting down notes on a napkin.
